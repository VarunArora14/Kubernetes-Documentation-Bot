### Kuberneted Documentation BotðŸ¤–


This project was submitted at **Google Gemini API Developer competition 2024**.

This repo is code for GenAI chatbot made to answer user queries about documentations. It has markdown data fed to it using **chromaDB** vector store.
The data consists of **markdown files** based of kubernetes documentation stored by me as personal notes in Joplin app. It uses **sentence transformers - all-MiniLM-L6-v2** for creating embeddings.

The initial idea was making it a personal notes bot but since I had lot of code and documentation code as part of my notes, I felt like calling it Documentation bot makes more sense.
APIs for both **HyDe** and **Decomposition** techniques exist separately. Make sure to create virtual environment and try running and hitting backend APIs using postman before starting frontend on streamlit.
